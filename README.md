# Manatee Watch

## Summary

Florida is well known for being home to manatees. Being the adorable sea cows that they are I constantly have friends and family visit looking to see manatees in person. While it’s not uncommon to see a manatee floating by in your local water way, they can be tricky to track down and aren’t always where you expect them to be. With little to no resources online to help tourists and locals alike, I was inspired to develop an app to help people find up to date manatee sighting locations in their area. A one stop map to show where they are, where they have been, and help you figure out where they might be next.

Users will be able to upload manatee sighting information - photos, coordinates, manatee info. That info will be used to populate the manatee sighting map that all users can view. Sightings associated with and accessible in individual users accounts so that data can be edited or deleted by the creator.
